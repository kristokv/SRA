The file mortality.R contains R code to estimate mortality for copepodite stage-pairs using a statistical regression approach (SRA).

The file dat.rda contains a synthetic dataset with copepodite abundances sampled at spatiotemporally resolved survey stations. 
Prior to sampling, the simulated copepodites developed from eggs according to ambient temperature and were subject to the following instantenous (daily) mortality rates: 
Eggs: 0.23, CI:0.09, CII: 0.105, CIII: 0.075, CIV: 0.03, CV: 0.025, CVI: 0.02
